loop_htbl_arn:
-------------

A c++ code to construct and diagonalize quantum Hamiltonians using the
Arnoldi method. Written by R Bondesan in 2010 and used for the
numerical computations of the peer-reviewed papers:

Roberto Bondesan, Jesper Lykke Jacobsen, Hubert Saleur,
`Edge states and conformal boundary conditions in super spin chains
and super sigma models', Nucl.Phys.B849:461-502,2011, arXiv:1101.4361 [hep-th]

Roberto Bondesan, Thomas Quella,
`Infinite Matrix Product States for long range SU(N) spin models',
Nucl.Phys.B886:483-523,2014, arXiv:1405.2971 [cond-mat.str-el]

Installation:
------------

Install by simply running make. 

Libraries requirements: superlu, arpack, lapack (These can be fetched
in Mac OS with brew, debian-based distros with apt-get)

Version: 1.0
Latest test: Mac Os Sierra

Run the code:
------------

Once successfully compiled, one prepares an init file containing all
the parameters of the model (what Hamiltonian, length of the system,
sector, number of low-lying eigenvalues etc.). See
e.g. init/TLperiodic/test for an example of an init file that compute
the low-lying states of a loop model. (H=-\sum_{i=1}^{2L} e_i, e_i
Temperley-Lieb generators). The code is then run as:

./loop_htbl_arn -finit/TLperiodic/test

Please refer to loop_htbl_arn for other command line options.

Note:
-----

The software uses the arpack++
(http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/arpack++.html), and the
present code includes a patched version of it in
arp++_include/. Unfortunately these still provide many warning due to
the use of deprecated commands. Extensive tests show that these
warnings have no consequence on the result of the calculations.
